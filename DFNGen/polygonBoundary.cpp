    /*! Checks if a point is within the polygon domain using a ray casting algorithm.
        1) create a parametric equation for a ray coming from the new Points
        * r(x) = newPoint.x + t * 1
        * r(y) = newPoint.y + t * 1
        * * This ray just goes along the x axis
        * 2) loop through initial vertices of the polygon.
        * Create a parametric equation for each edge
        * l(x) = x + u * mx
        * l(y) = y + u * my
        * 3) find point of intersection between the two rays
        * 4) determine if the point is on the boundary of the polygon.
        * 5) count the number of times the ray emitting from the point crosses the boundary of the polygon
        * if the count is zero or even, the point is outside the domain,
        * if the count is odd, the point is inside the domain

// The minimum size options in the input files will still be used.
// If the user wishes to also removeFractures after DFN generation,

// after DFN has been created.

//        removed.
