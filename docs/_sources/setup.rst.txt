Setting and Running up dfnWorks
================================

Docker
------------------------------
The easiest way to get started with dfnWorks is using our docker container (https://hub.docker.com/r/ees16/dfnworks).

If you do not already have Docker installed on your machine,
visit `Getting Started with Docker <https://www.docker.com/get-started>`_.

The dfnWorks Docker image can be pulled from DockerHub using:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker pull ees16/dfnworks:latest


Running the dfnWorks container
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The base command for running the dfnWorks container is:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -ti ees16/dfnworks:latest

However, to exchange files between the host and container, we will need to mount
a volume.

The option ``-v LOCAL_FOLDER:/dfnWorks/work`` will allow all files present in the
container folder ``dfnWorks/work`` to be exposed to ``LOCAL_FOLDER``, where
``LOCAL_FOLDER`` is the absolute path to a folder on your machine.

With this is place, the final command for running the Docker container is:

**On macOS:**

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -ti -v <LOCAL_FOLDER>:/dfnWorks/work ees16/dfnworks:latest

Native build from github repository
------------------------------------------

This document contains instructions for setting up dfnWorks natively on your
machine. To setup dfnWorks using Docker instead, see the next section.

Clone the dnfWorks repository
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/lanl/dfnWorks.git


Fix paths in test directory 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fix the pathnames in files throughout pydfnworks. This can be done automatically by running the script ``fix_paths.py``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd dfnWorks/pydfnworks/bin/
    $ python fix_paths.py 

Set the LagriT, PETSC, PFLOTRAN, Python, and FEHM paths 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Before executing dfnWorks,** the following paths must be set:

- dfnWorks_PATH: the dfnWorks repository folder
- PETSC_DIR and PETSC_ARCH: PETSC environmental variables
- PFLOTRAN_EXE:  Path to PFLOTRAN executable 
- PYTHON_EXE:  Path to python executable 
- LAGRIT_EXE:  Path to LaGriT executable 

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ vi dfnWorks/pydfnworks/pydfnworks/paths.py

For example:

.. code-block:: python
    
    os.environ['dfnWorks_PATH'] = '/home/username/dfnWorks/'    

Alternatively, you can create a ``.dfnworksrc`` file in your home directory with the following format

.. code-block:: bash

    {
        "dfnworks_PATH": "<your-home-directory>/src/dfnworks-main/",
        "PETSC_DIR": "<your-home-directory>/src/petsc",
        "PETSC_ARCH": "arch-darwin-c-debug",
        "PFLOTRAN_EXE": "<your-home-directory>/src/pflotran/src/pflotran/pflotran",
        "PYTHON_EXE": "<your-home-directory>/anaconda3/bin/python",
        "LAGRIT_EXE": "<your-home-directory>/bin/lagrit",
        "FEHM_EXE": "<your-home-directory>//src/xfehm_v3.3.1"
    }


Installing pydfnworks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Go up into the pydfnworks sub-directory:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ cd dfnWorks/pydfnworks/

Complie The pydfnWorks Package:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ python setup.py bdist_wheel


Install on Your Local Machine:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ python -m pip install dist/pydfnworks-2.6-py3-none-any.whl

**Note that the python version in dist/ needs to be consistent with the current release**

Installation Requirements for Native Build
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tools that you will need to run the dfnWorks work flow are described in 
this section. VisIt and ParaView, which enable visualization of desired 
quantities on the DFNs, are optional, but at least one of them is highly 
recommended for visualization. CMake is also optional but allows faster IO 
processing using C++. 

Operating Systems
*****************************

dfnWorks currently runs on Macs and Unix machine running Ubuntu. 

Python 
*****************************

pydfnworks uses Python 3. We recommend using 
the Anaconda 3 distribution of Python, available at https://www.continuum.io/. 
pydfnworks requires the following python modules: ``numpy``, ``h5py``, ``scipy``, ``matplotlib``,  ``multiprocessing``, ``argparse``, ``shutil``, ``os``, ``sys``, ``networkx``, ``subprocess``, ``glob``, ``networkx``, ``fpdf``, and ``re``.


LaGriT
******
The LaGriT_ meshing toolbox is used to create a high resolution computational 
mesh representation of the DFN in parallel. An algorithm for conforming 
Delaunay triangulation is implemented so that fracture intersections are 
coincident with triangle edges in the mesh and Voronoi control volumes are 
suitable for finite volume flow solvers such as FEHM and PFLOTRAN.

.. _LaGriT: https://lagrit.lanl.gov

PFLOTRAN
********
PFLOTRAN_  is a massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport 
code. PFLOTRAN solves a system of partial differential equations for 
multiphase, multicomponent and multi-scale reactive flow and transport in 
porous media. The code is designed to run on leadership-class supercomputers 
as well as workstations and laptops.

.. _PFLOTRAN: http://pflotran.org

FEHM
****
FEHM_ is a subsurface multiphase flow code developed at Los Alamos National 
Laboratory.

.. _FEHM: https://fehm.lanl.gov

CMake
*****************************
CMake_ is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, 
test and package software. It is needed to use C++ for processing files at a 
bottleneck IO step of dfnWorks. Using C++ for this file processing optional 
but can greatly increase the speed of dfnWorks for large fracture networks. 
Details on how to use C++ for file processing are in the scripts section of 
this documentation.

.. _CMake: https://cmake.org

Paraview
*****************************

Paraview_ is a parallel, open-source visualisation software. PFLOTRAN can 
output in ``.xmf`` and ``.vtk`` format. These can be imported in Paraview 
for visualization. While not required for running dfnWorks, Paraview is
very helpful for visualizing dfnWorks simulations.

Instructions for downloading and installing Paraview_ can be found at 
http://www.paraview.org/download/
