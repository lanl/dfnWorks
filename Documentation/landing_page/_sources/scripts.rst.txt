Scripts
========

The pydfnworks package has four Python scripts that assist with compiling, testing, and running the software. These scripts are all in the folder ``dfnWorks/pydfnworks/bin/`` . 

fix_paths.py: fix the paths in the tests folder
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The tests that come with dfnWorks depend on pathnames which vary depending on where dfnWorks is installed. To fix these paths automatically, run the ''fix_paths.py'' script accordingly:

``python fix_paths.py`` 

compile.py: compile dfnWorks components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``compile.py`` script is called by ``run.py``, but can also be called on its own. This script compiles the C and C++ components of dfnWorks. Without arguments, the script performs the compiling. With the argument 'clean,' the script cleans up C and C++ object files, before compiling.

test.py: test dfnWorks 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``test.py`` script can be used to easily test functionality of dfnWorks. It runs a test suite (input files contained in the tests folder) that test the exponential, power law, and lognormal distributions as well as user-defined ellipses and user-defined rectangle fracture inputs. The syntax is:

``python test.py [TEST_NAME_PART]``

Here ``[TEST_NAME_PART]`` is all or part of the name of the tests the user wants to run.

run.py: run dfnWorks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The run.py script allows the user to execute a single run of dfnWorks. The syntax for this script is:

``python run.py -name [JOBNAME] -input [INPUT_FILE_NAME] -ncpu [NUMBER OF CPUS TO USE]`` 

Please refer to the tutorial section (the next section for a detailed description of how to run dfnWorks.
