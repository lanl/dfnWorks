Introduction
============

dfnWorks is a parallelized computational suite to generate three-dimensional 
discrete fracture networks (DFN) and simulate flow and transport. Developed at 
Los Alamos National Laboratory, it has been used to study flow and transport 
in fractured media at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers. The 
networks are created and meshed using dfnGen, which combines FRAM (the feature 
rejection algorithm for meshing) methodology to stochastically generate 
three-dimensional DFNs with the LaGriT meshing toolbox to create a high-quality 
computational mesh representation. The representation produces a conforming 
Delaunay triangulation suitable for high performance computing finite volume 
solvers in an intrinsically parallel fashion. Flow through the network is 
simulated with dfnFlow, which utilizes the massively parallel subsurface flow 
and reactive transport finite volume code PFLOTRAN. A Lagrangian approach to 
simulating transport through the DFN is adopted within dfnTrans to determine 
pathlines and solute transport through the DFN. Applications of the dfnWorks 
suite include nuclear waste repository science, hydraulic fracturing and 
|CO2| sequestration.

To run a workflow using the dfnWorks suite, the pydfnworks package is 
highly recommended. pydfnworks calls various tools in the dfnWorks suite with 
the aim to provide a seamless workflow for scientific applications of dfnWorks.

What's new in v2.0?
-------------------

- New dfnGen C++ code which is much faster than the Mathematica dfnGen. This code has successfully generated networks with 350,000+ fractures. 
- Increased functionality in the pydfnworks package for more streamlined workflow from dfnGen through visualization. 

What's new in v2.1?
-------------------

- Bug fixes in LaGrit Meshing 
- Increased functionalities in pydfnworks including the path option


Where can one get dfnWorks?
---------------------------
dfnWorks 2.1 can be downloaded from https://github.com/lanl/dfnWorks/

v1.0 can be downloaded from https://github.com/dfnWorks/dfnWorks-Version1.0  


Installation
------------
Tools that you will need to run the dfnWorks work flow are described in 
this section. VisIt and ParaView, which enable visualization of desired 
quantities on the DFNs, are optional, but at least one of them is highly 
recommended for visualization. CMake is also optional but allows faster IO 
processing using C++. 

Python 
^^^^^^

pydfnworks is supported on Python 2.7. The software authors recommend using 
the Anaconda 2.7 distribution of Python, available at https://www.continuum.io/. 
pydfnworks requires the ``numpy`` and ``h5py`` modules to be installed.

pydfnworks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The source for pydfnworks can be found in the dfnWorks suite, in the folder 
pydfnworks. 

dfnGen
^^^^^^
dfnGen primarily involves two steps: FRAM (the feature rejection algorithm for meshing) and LaGriT, the meshing tool box used to create a 
conforming Delaunay triangulation of the network.

FRAM
******
FRAM (the feature rejection algorithm for meshing) is executed using the 
dfnGen C++ source code, contained in the dfnGen folder of the dfnWorks repository.

LaGriT
******
The LaGriT_ meshing toolbox is used to create a high resolution computational 
mesh representation of the DFN in parallel. An algorithm for conforming 
Delaunay triangulation is implemented so that fracture intersections are 
coincident with triangle edges in the mesh and Voronoi control volumes are 
suitable for finite volume flow solvers such as FEHM and PFLOTRAN.

.. _LaGriT: https://lagrit.lanl.gov

dfnFlow
^^^^^^^
You will need one of either PFLOTRAN or FEHM to solve for flow using the 
mesh files from LaGriT. 

PFLOTRAN
********
PFLOTRAN_  is a massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport 
code. PFLOTRAN solves a system of partial differential equations for 
multiphase, multicomponent and multiscale reactive flow and transport in 
porous media. The code is designed to run on leadership-class supercomputers 
as well as workstations and laptops.

.. _PFLOTRAN: http://pflotran.org

FEHM
****
FEHM_ is a subsurface multiphase flow code developed at Los Alamos National 
Laboratory.

.. _FEHM: https://fehm.lanl.gov

dfnTrans
^^^^^^^^
dfnTrans is a method for resolving solute transport using control volume flow 
solutions obtained from dfnFlow on the unstructured mesh generated using 
dfnGen. We adopt a Lagrangian approach and represent a non-reactive 
conservative solute as a collection of indivisible passive tracer particles.  

CMake
^^^^^^^
CMake_ is an open-source, cross-platform family of tools designed to build, 
test and package software. It is needed to use C++ for processing files at a 
bottleneck IO step of dfnWorks. Using C+C++ for this file processing optional 
but can greatly increase the speed of dfnWorks for large fracture networks. 
Details on how to use C++ for file processing are in the scripts section of 
this documentation.

.. _CMake: https://cmake.org

VisIt
^^^^^

VisIt_ is a parallel, open-source visualisation software. PFLOTRAN can output 
in ``.xmf`` and ``.vtk`` format. These can be imported in VisIt for visualization. 

Instructions for downloading and installing VisIt_ can be found at 
https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit/download.html 

.. _VisIt: https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/visit

Paraview
^^^^^^^^

Paraview_ is a parallel, open-source visualisation software. PFLOTRAN can 
output in ``.xmf`` and ``.vtk`` format. These can be imported in Paraview 
for visualization. 

Instructions for downloading and installing Paraview_ can be found at 
http://www.paraview.org/download/

Using pydfnworks in your Python scripts
--------------------------------------------

To access the functionality of pydfnworks, the user must include the 
following line at the 
top of any Python script

.. code-block:: python
	
	import pydfnworks 

Before doing this, one needs to ensure that the pydfnworks directory is in the 
PYTHONPATH. This can be done by configuring ``cshrc`` or ``bashrc`` files. 
Alternatively, one can add the pydfnworks path using ``sys.path.append()`` 
in their driver script.

About this  manual
------------------

This manual comprises of information on setting up inputs to dfnGen, dfnTrans 
and PFLOTRAN, as well as details on the pydfnworks module: :ref:`pydfnworks 
<dfnWorks-python-chapter>`. Finally, the manual contains a short tutorial 
with prepared examples that  can be found in the ``tests`` directory of the 
dfnWorks repository, and a description of some applications of the dfnWorks 
suite.
