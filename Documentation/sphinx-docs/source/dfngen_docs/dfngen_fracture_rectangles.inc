Fracture Family Generation Parameters: Rectangle
**************************************************

This section describes generation parameters for families of rectangular fractures. The number of elements in each parameter matches the number of rectangle families in :ref:`nFamRect`. The index of the elements corresponds to the fracture family. The first element of each parameter corresponds to the first family, the second element corresponds to the second family, etc. 

.. warning:: The parameters shown in this section are automatically written to the parameter dictionary (DFN.params) when defining fracture families. Documentation here is meant to provide additional information on the definition of each parameter in the parameter dictionary. For information on setting these parameters see :ref:`pydfnGen <dfnWorks-python-chapter-dfnGen>` 


Rectangle: General Parameters
=================================

nFamRect
----------------------------------

Description: Number of rectangle families

Type: Non-Negative Integer
 
Default: 0

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    DFN.params['nFamRect']['value'] = 3 # There will be 3 rectangle families

    # Family 2 is assigned to layer 2
    # Family 3 is assigned to layer 1
    
.. note:: Layer 0 is the entire domain. Numbers > 0 correspond to those defined in :ref:`layers`.

.. warning:: Families can only be assigned to either a layer or a region, not both.
 
----


rRegion
----------------------------------

Description: Assign each rectangle family to a region in domain. 

Type: list of :ref:`nFamRect`  integers

----------------------------------

Description: Target fracture intensity per family. Fracture intensity :math:`P_{32} [\text{m}^{-1}]` is defined as total surface area of each fracture family divided by the total domain volume. Fractures from each family are inserted into the domain until provided target values are obtained. Generation stops once all desired fracture intensity are obtained.

Type: list of :ref:`nFamRect`  floats 

Example:

.. code-block:: python


    DFN.params['r_p32Targets']['value'] = [0.02,0.4,0.05] 
    # Family 1 has a target p32 of 0.02 
    # Family 2 has a target p32 of 0.4 
    # Family 3 has a target p32 of 0.05

    # Family 2 has an aspect ratio of 2 - y radius is twice the x radius
    # Family 3 has an aspect ratio of 0.5 - y radius is 1/2 the x radius
    
.. note:: A value of 1 makes squares
 
----



Rectangle: Fracture Orientation
=================================

The fracture orientations are sampled from the three-dimensional von Mises-Fisher distribution,

.. math:: 
    f({\bf x}; {\boldsymbol \mu}, \kappa ) = \frac{ \kappa \exp( \kappa {\boldsymbol \mu}^{T} {\bf x} )}{ 4 \pi \sinh(\kappa)}~.

where :math:`{\boldsymbol \mu}` is the mean orientation vector and :math:`T` denotes transpose. 
The distribution is sampled using the algorithm provided `Simulation of the von Mises Fisher distribution Communications in statistics-simulation and computation 23.1 (1994): 157-164. by Andrew Wood. <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03610919408813161?casa_token=Cc-XXhvQTLcAAAAA%3A9pwlcB4cnrLeMs6UZWGaA7W84VevBrWD_bMvulGrKyFwFDA4ZYunOvO-XIpmf17XKgHqFQH1gzwZkw&>`_. 

dfnGen accepts spherical coordinates (:math:`\theta`/:math:`\phi`), Trend/Plunge, or Dip/Strike to define the mean orientation of a fracture family. 

.. tip:: 
    :ref:`orientationOption` indicates which of these options are used. This is automatically set based on which option is used during fracture family parameter generation.  The same option must be used for all families.

    | 0 : Spherical Coordinate (Theta/Phi)
    | 1 : Trend / Plunge
    | 2 : Dip / Strike.

----

rkappa
----------------------------------

Description: The concentration parameter of the von Mises-Fisher  distribution, which determines the degree of clustering around the mean orientation. 

Type: list of :ref:`nFamRect` floats 

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    DFN.params['rkappa']['value'] = [0.1, 20, 17] 
    # Fracture Family 1 has a theta value of 45 degrees
    # Fracture Family 2 has a theta value of 78 degrees
    # Fracture Family 3 has a theta value of 0 degrees
    
.. note:: Values of :math:`\kappa` approaching zero result in a uniform distribution of points on the sphere.  Larger values create points with a small deviation from mean direction. 

.. warning:: The numerical method for sampling the von Mises-Fisher  distribution becomes unstable for values greater than 100.

with mean :math:`\mu` and variance :math:`\sigma^2`.

.. warning:: dfnGen uses the mean and standard deviation of the underlying normal distribution that creates the lognormal distribution not the mean and variance of the lognormal distribution.


In order to produce a LogNormal distribution with a desired mean (:math:`\mu`) and variance (:math:`\sigma^2`) one uses

.. math::
    eLogMean = \ln  \left ( \frac{\mu^2}{\sqrt{\mu^2 + \sigma^2}} \right)

and 

.. math::
    esd =  \sqrt{\ln \left ( 1 + \frac{ \sigma^2}{\mu^2} \right )}
