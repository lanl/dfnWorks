Welcome To dfnWorks
=========================

dfnWorks is a parallelized computational suite to generate three-dimensional 
discrete fracture networks (DFN) and simulate flow and transport. Developed at 
Los Alamos National Laboratory, it has been used to study flow and transport 
in fractured media at scales ranging from millimeters to kilometers. The 
networks are created and meshed using dfnGen, which combines FRAM (the feature 
rejection algorithm for meshing) methodology to stochastically generate 
three-dimensional DFNs with the LaGriT meshing toolbox to create a high-quality 
computational mesh representation. The representation produces a conforming 
Delaunay triangulation suitable for high-performance computing finite volume 
solvers in an intrinsically parallel fashion. Flow through the network is 
simulated with dfnFlow, which utilizes the massively parallel subsurface flow 
and reactive transport finite volume code PFLOTRAN. A Lagrangian approach to 
simulating transport through the DFN is adopted within dfnTrans to determine 
pathlines and solute transport through the DFN. Applications of the dfnWorks 
suite include nuclear waste repository science, hydraulic fracturing and 
|CO2| sequestration.

To run a workflow using the dfnWorks suite, the pydfnworks package is 
highly recommended. pydfnworks calls various tools in the dfnWorks suite with 
the aim to provide a seamless workflow for scientific applications of dfnWorks.

About this  manual
------------------

This manual comprises of information on setting up inputs to dfnGen, dfnTrans 
and PFLOTRAN, as well as details on the pydfnworks module: :ref:`pydfnworks 
<dfnWorks-python-chapter>`. Finally, the manual contains a short tutorial 
with prepared examples that  can be found in the ``examples`` directory of the 
dfnWorks repository, and a description of some applications of the dfnWorks 
suite.
